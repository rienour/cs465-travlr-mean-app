# CS 465: Full Stack MEAN Application

The goal is to create a full stack application to demonstrate the student understanding of a tech stack which involves MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node (MEAN).

## Demonstrations

The following considerations should be made while developing the application as a means to demonstrate good coding practices.

### Customer-Facing Website

Develop and run a complex public customer-facing web application that meets software requirements.

### MVC Routing

The customer-facing website must be an Express web application with routes, controllers, views, and data models.

### Static HTML to Templates With JSON

Use the Handlebars (HBS) templating engine to move the static HTML site to templates to render JSON data dynamically within the application.

### NoSQL Database

Configure a NoSQL database using Mongoose to store data in the server side of the software application.

### RESTful API

Integrate RESTful API with a NoSQL database, which is organized using models and schemas with existing software frameworks.

### SPA

Use frameworks to include rich functionality and features in a SPA to meet software requirements. Use the test data provided and add other examples of tours with dates and other data to test the SPA.

### Security

Refactor the code to add security controls, including a login form, and apply best practices to ensure authorized access using secure endpoints.
